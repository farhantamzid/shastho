# Active Context

## Current Phase

We are transitioning from project initialization to implementation phase. The PRD has been analyzed, initial tasks have been generated, and the frontend design system has been completed. The key focus now is implementing the core application structure and database schema.

## Most Recent Decisions

1. **Task Breakdown Structure**:

   - Created 25 core tasks based on PRD requirements
   - Expanded tasks into subtasks based on complexity analysis
   - Successfully completed Task #26 for establishing frontend design guidelines from frontendExamples/

2. **Repository Approach**:

   - Decided to use the existing Git repository structure
   - Will organize code within the current repository following Flask conventions
   - Updated Task #1 to reflect this decision

3. **Frontend Design System Implementation**:
   - Completed comprehensive design system based on frontendExamples/
   - Created reusable components for buttons, forms, navigation, layouts
   - Established design tokens for colors, typography, spacing
   - Documented coding standards and layout patterns
   - All design system components use Tailwind CSS for styling

## Current Work Focus

The immediate focus is on:

1. **Project Structure Setup** (Task #1):

   - Setting up Flask application structure
   - Configuring Tailwind CSS integration with established design system
   - Establishing folder organization
   - Creating initial configuration files

2. **Database Schema Design** (Task #2):
   - Designing user/authentication tables
   - Planning hospital/department/doctor schema
   - Structuring appointment and EHR tables

## Next Steps

1. Implement Task #1 (Project Structure) to set up the development environment
2. Begin Task #2 (Database Schema) to create the data foundation
3. Proceed to Task #3 (User Authentication) once the foundations are in place
4. Start integrating the completed design system into the Flask templates

## Open Questions

1. Should we start with a minimal subset of user roles for initial implementation?
2. Are there any specific Supabase configuration details needed for database setup?
3. Should we implement multilingual support from the beginning or add it later?
4. What's the best approach to integrate the design system components into Flask templates?

## Blockers

Currently no major blockers exist. The design system is complete and ready for integration with the Flask application.
