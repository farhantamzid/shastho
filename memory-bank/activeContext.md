# Active Context

## Current Phase

We are in the implementation phase. The PRD has been analyzed, initial tasks have been generated, the frontend design system has been completed, and the basic project structure is now set up. The key focus has been implementing the user authentication system and improving UI components.

## Most Recent Decisions

1. **Application Name Change**:

   - Changed the application name from "HealthBD" to "shastho" throughout the codebase
   - Updated all templates, component docstrings, and documentation with the new name
   - This change ensures consistent branding across the application

2. **Task Breakdown Structure**:

   - Created 25 core tasks based on PRD requirements
   - Expanded tasks into subtasks based on complexity analysis
   - Successfully completed Task #26 for establishing frontend design guidelines from frontendExamples/
   - Successfully completed Task #1 for setting up project structure and environment
   - Successfully completed Task #3 for implementing user authentication

3. **Repository Approach**:

   - Decided to use the existing Git repository structure
   - Organized code within the current repository following Flask conventions
   - Created proper directory structure with app/components, app/models, app/routes, etc.

4. **Frontend Design System Implementation**:

   - Completed comprehensive design system based on frontendExamples/
   - Created reusable components for buttons, forms, navigation, layouts
   - Established design tokens for colors, typography, spacing
   - Documented coding standards and layout patterns
   - All design system components use Tailwind CSS for styling

5. **UI Improvements**:
   - Fixed spacing issues in form input fields, particularly in confirm password field
   - Improved navbar layout with better spacing between elements
   - Enhanced responsive design for mobile screens
   - Implemented proper user name display in navigation after login
   - Created clean, consistent styling for authentication forms

## Current Work Focus

The immediate focus is on:

1. **Database Schema Design** (Task #2):

   - Designing user/authentication tables
   - Planning hospital/department/doctor schema
   - Structuring appointment and EHR tables

2. **User Authentication System** (Task #3):
   - ✅ Implemented basic login/registration functionality
   - ✅ Set up role-based access control
   - ✅ Created session management
   - ✅ Implemented form validation
   - ✅ Added demo user accounts for testing

## Next Steps

1. Complete Task #2 (Database Schema) to create the data foundation
2. ✅ Complete Task #3 (User Authentication)
3. Implement Task #4 (Patient Registration)
4. Continue with Task #5 (System Admin Portal)

## Open Questions

1. Should we start with a minimal subset of user roles for initial implementation?
2. Are there any specific Supabase configuration details needed for database setup?
3. Should we implement multilingual support from the beginning or add it later?
4. What's the best approach for structuring the EHR data to ensure privacy while maintaining accessibility?

## Blockers

Currently no major blockers exist. The basic Flask application structure is working, and we're ready to implement the database schema.
