# Product Context

## What is shastho?

shastho is a web-based application designed to enhance public healthcare in Bangladesh by providing a centralized National Electronic Health Record (EHR) system and a streamlined online Appointment Scheduling System for public hospitals. The platform addresses critical gaps in the country's healthcare infrastructure by digitizing health records and simplifying access to medical services.

## Key Problems shastho Solves

### Problem 1: Fragmented Medical Records

Currently, patient medical histories in Bangladesh are fragmented across different hospitals and healthcare providers, with most records maintained on paper. This leads to:

- **Incomplete medical history** when patients visit different facilities
- **Repeated tests and examinations** due to lack of previous results
- **Medication errors** without comprehensive prescription history
- **Inefficient healthcare delivery** due to time spent reconstructing patient history

shastho solves this by creating a centralized EHR system that:

- Maintains complete medical histories in one secure location
- Allows authorized healthcare providers to access relevant patient information
- Reduces redundant tests and improves care continuity
- Empowers patients to view and share their own medical records

### Problem 2: Inefficient Appointment Booking

The current appointment booking process in Bangladesh's public hospitals is largely manual, requiring:

- **Physical presence** at hospitals for booking
- **Long waiting lines** and administrative delays
- **Limited visibility** into doctor availability
- **No streamlined system** for rescheduling or cancellations

shastho addresses this with an online appointment scheduling system that:

- Allows patients to book appointments remotely
- Provides real-time visibility into doctor availability
- Enables easy rescheduling and cancellation
- Reduces congestion and waiting times at hospitals
